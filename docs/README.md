# Supported algorithms

ACL aims to support a few core algorithms that are well suited for production use and other algorithms that are interesting to compare against.

*  [Uniformly sampled](algorithm_uniformly_sampled.md)

# How to integrate the library

*  [Handling asserts](handling_asserts.md)
*  [Implementing an allocator](implementing_an_allocator.md)
*  [Creating a raw track list](creating_a_raw_track_list.md)
*  [Compressing tracks](compressing_raw_tracks.md)
*  [Decompressing tracks](decompressing_a_track_list.md)
*  [Other considerations](misc_integration_details.md)

See how it's integrated into Unreal Engine 4 [here](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin)!
