# Getting started

In order to contribute to ACL and use the various tools provided for development and research, you will first need to setup your environment.

## Setting up your environment

### Windows, Linux, and OS X for x86 and x64

1. Install *CMake 3.2* or higher (*3.10* is required on OS X with *Xcode 10*), *Python 3*, and the proper compiler for your platform.
2. Execute `git submodule update --init` to get the files of thirdparty submodules (e.g. Catch2).
3. Generate the IDE solution with: `python make.py`  
   The solution is generated under `./build`  
   Note that if you do not have CMake in your `PATH`, you should define the `ACL_CMAKE_HOME` environment variable to something like `C:\Program Files\CMake`.
4. Build the IDE solution with: `python make.py -build`
5. Run the unit tests with: `python make.py -unit_test`
6. Run the regression tests with: `python make.py -regression_test`

On all three platforms, *AVX* support can be enabled by using the `-avx` switch.

### Windows ARM64

For *Windows on ARM64*, the steps are identical to *x86 and x64* but you will need *CMake 3.13 or higher* and you must provide the architecture on the command line: `python make.py -compiler vs2017 -cpu arm64`

### Android

For *Android*, the steps are identical to *Windows, Linux, and OS X* but you also need to install *NVIDIA CodeWorks 1R5* (or higher).

Note that it is not currently possible to run the unit tests or the regression tests with scripts, you will need to run them manually from Visual Studio:

*  Open the Visual Studio solution
*  Build and run on your device

Note that Android builds have never been tested on an emulator and that if you cannot code sign the APK, you will need to change the project ANT settings to use the debug configuration.

*We currently only support NVIDIA CodeWorks as that is what is used by Unreal 4 to build. Contributions welcome to also support the NDK natively with CMake*

### iOS

For *iOS*, the steps are identical to the other platforms but due to code signing, you will need to perform the builds from *Xcode* manually. Note that this is only an issue if you attempt to use the tools or the unit tests locally.

In order to run these manually:

*  Open the *Xcode* project for the appropriate tool
*  In the project settings, enable automatic code signing and select your development team
*  Build and run on your device

Note that *iOS* builds have never been tested on an emulator.

## Commit message format

This library uses the [angular.js message format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) and it is enforced with commit linting through every pull request.

## Generating the stats and graphs

See [here](graph_generation.md) to find out how the various statistics and graphs we track are generated.
