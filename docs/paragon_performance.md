| **Compression ratio** | 20.53 : 1 | 19.56 : 1 | 20.69 : 1     |

| **Compression speed**  | 7027.87 KB/sec | 2521.62 KB/sec | 167.80 KB/sec |
| **Max error**         | 2.8669 cm | 4.0184 cm | 7.0175 cm     |
| **Error 99<sup>th</sup> percentile** | 0.0099 cm | 0.0116 cm | 0.0116 cm |

Notes:

*  The error is unusually high and above **1 cm** for **4** exotic clips
*  Starting with v1.3.0 measurements have been made with a Ryzen 2950X CPU while prior versions used an Intel i7 6850K.

# Data and method used

To compile these statistics, a large number of animations from [Paragon](https://www.epicgames.com/paragon) are used.

In *October 2017* the animations were manually extracted and converted to the [ACL file format](the_acl_file_format.md) losslessly. The data is sadly **NOT** available upon request.
Epic has permitted [Nicholas Frechette](https://github.com/nfrechette) to use them for research purposes only under a non-disclosure agreement.

*  Number of clips: **6558**
*  Total duration: **7h 0m 45.27s**
*  Raw size: **4276.11 MB** (10x float32 * num bones * num samples)

The data set contains among other things:

*  Lots of characters with varying number of bones
*  Animated objects of various shape and form
*  Very short and very long clips
*  Clips with unusual sample rate (as low as **2** FPS!)
*  World space clips
*  Lots of 3D scale
*  Lots of other exotic clips

ACL supports various compression methods but only the overall best variant will be tracked here (see `get_default_compression_settings()` for details).

The error is measured **3cm** away from each bone to simulate the visual mesh skinning process as described [here](error_metrics.md) with the default error threshold of **0.01cm**. The **99th** percentile and the number of samples below the error threshold are calculated by measuring the error on every bone at every sample.

The performance of ACL in Unreal Engine 4 is tracked by the plugin [here](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin/blob/develop/Docs/paragon_performance.md).
