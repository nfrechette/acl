# Decompressing a track list

Once you have a [compressed track list](compressing_raw_tracks.md), the first order of business to decompress it is to select a set of `decompression_settings`. The decompression settings `struct` is populated with `constexpr` functions that can be overridden to turn on or off the code generation per feature.

The next thing you need is a `decompression_context` instance. This will allow you to actually decompress tracks. You can also use it to seek arbitrarily in the list. For safety, the decompression context is templated with the decompression settings.

```c++
#include "acl/decompression/decompress.h"

using namespace acl;

decompression_context<default_decompression_settings> context;

context.initialize(*tracks);
context.seek(sample_time, sample_rounding_policy::none);

// create an instance of 'track_writer' so we can write the output somewhere
context.decompress_track(track_index, my_track_writer); // a single track
context.decompress_tracks(my_track_writer); // all tracks
```

As shown, a context must be initialized with a compressed track list instance. Some context objects such as the one used by uniform sampling can be re-used by any compressed track list and does not need to be re-created while others might require this. In order to detect when this might be required, the function `is_dirty(const compressed_tracks& tracks)` is provided. Some context objects cannot be created on the stack and must be dynamically allocated with an allocator instance. The functions `make_decompression_context(...)` are provided for this purpose.

You can seek anywhere in a track list but you will need to handle looping manually in your game engine. When seeking, you must also provide a `sample_rounding_policy` to dictate how the interpolation is to be performed. See [here](../includes/acl/core/interpolation_utils.h) for details.

Every decompression function supported by the context is prefixed with `decompress_*`. A `track_writer` is used for optimized output writing. You can implement your own and coerce to your own math types. The type is templated on the `decompress_*` functions in order to be easily inlined.

## Floating point exceptions

For performance reasons, the decompression code assumes that the caller has already disabled all floating point exceptions. This avoids the need to save/restore them with every call. ACL provides helpers in [acl/core/floating_point_exceptions.h](..\includes\acl\core\floating_point_exceptions.h) to assist and optionally this behavior can be controlled by overriding `decompression_settings::disable_fp_exeptions()`.
